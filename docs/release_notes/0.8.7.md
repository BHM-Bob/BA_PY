## Focus on  
1. Fix scripts bug in v0.8.6
2. Improve HPLC and Mass scripts

  
## What's New  
None or a little.   
  

## Minor Addon
- minor-addon: mbapy\scripts\peptide.py: feat(peptide): add option to retain old match records in mass data
Introduce a new command-line argument `--remain-old-match` in the `fit_mass` command to allow users to keep previous match records when processing mass data. This option defaults to False, meaning old matches are cleared by default, but can be enabled to maintain the historic match data.  
- minor-addon: mbapy\scripts\_main_.py: feat(mba-scripts): add functionality to load session from file
Introduce new capability to the main script execution path that allows loading a session from a .mpss file. This enhances the mbapy CLI by providing a way to resume previous sessions directly from the command line.  
- minor-addon: mbapy\sci_instrument\mass\SCIEX.py: feat(sciex): implement SciexMZMine class for MZMine data processing
Add a new subclass SciexMZMine in the SCIEX module, designed for handling data files with MZMine soft. This subclass extends SciexOriData, incorporating specific data loading and processing methods tailored for MZMine data format.  


## BUG-FIX  
- fix-bug: mbapy\scripts\_script_utils_.py: The script has been updated to correctly show the total_size in bytes, resolving an issue where the incorrect variable was being printed.  
- fix-bug: mbapy\sci_instrument\hplc\_base.py: HplcData: search_peaks: self.peaks_idx get right value when ed is not None  
- fix-bug: mbapy\scripts\_script_utils_.py: excute_command: put issubclass check into a try block.  

  
## CODE-FIX 
- fix-code: mbapy\scripts\hplc.py: explore-hplc: improve manual peaking  
- fix-code: mbapy\sci_instrument\hplc\_base.py: HplcData: search_peaks: st and ed minus t0 now to fit refined x, so peaks works in refined x-axis now  
- fix-code: mbapy\scripts\mass.py: fix(mass.py): ensure legend fits in figure by adjusting size dynamically
When the legend size exceeds the figure size, the plot is resized to accommodate the legend, preventing fig resized. This improvement checks the legend's size and adjusts the figure dimensions accordingly, making sure that the legend is fully visible within the plot area.  
- mbapy\scripts\mass.py: fix(mass.py): correct indentation for peak filtering logic
Indentation in the `plot_mass` class of `mass.py` was adjusted to ensure proper execution flow. Previously, the call to `filter_peaks` was not properly indented, causing it to execute outside of the intended block. This fix aligns the call to `filter_peaks` with the preceding `search_peaks` call, guaranteeing that peak filtering occurs as expected after peak search.
