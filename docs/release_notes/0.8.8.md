## Focus on  
1. imporve scripts/peptide: mmw
2. Improve HPLC data processing

  
## What's New  
- addon: mbapy\sci_instrument\hplc\Easychrom.py: add Easychrom data processing functionality
Implement EasychromData class for processing raw HPLC data, extending the SciexData
class. This includes parsing raw data files, scaling y-axis data, and handling of
data frames. Also, integrate EasychromData into the hplc module and initiate
unit tests for validation.  
- feat(tests): add unit tests for Sciex data processing in HPLC module
Extend the unittest suite for the HPLC SCIEX data processing functionalities.
This includes the addition of tests for loading raw data files and processed data
files, ensuring the correctness of data loading and processing mechanisms.

  

## Minor Addon
- minor addon: mbapy\bio\peptide.py: AnimoAcid: implement hash method for AnimoAcid class
Added a custom hash method to the AnimoAcid class to enable its instances to be used as keys in dictionaries. The hash function combines the hashes of the
individual properties (N_protect, animo_acid, C_protect, R_protect) to produce a unique hash for each instance.  
- minor addon: mbapy\bio\peptide.py: Peptide: add hash method to Peptide class for dictionary usage
Implement a custom hash method for the Peptide class to allow its instances to be used as keys in dictionaries. The hash function is based on the peptide's representation, ensuring a unique hash for each instance.  
- minor-adon: mbapy\sci_instrument\_base.py: SciInstrumentData: process_raw_data: add y_scale parameter for scaling y-axis data
Introduce a `y_scale` parameter in the `process_raw_data` method of `SciInstrumentData` class to allow for calibration of the y-axis data. This feature is particularly useful when the data needs to be scaled before further processing or analysis.
Additionally, updated the import order in `SCIEX.py` for consistency and applied a minor code cleanup.  
- minor-addon: mbapy\scripts\hplc.py: add support for Easychrom data processing
Extend the HplcData model to include EasychromData and update the plot_hplc class
to support the new system in data processing and suffix mapping. This
enhancement allows for the handling of additional HPLC data formats and
improves the module's compatibility with various instruments.
- feat(bio): implement __len__ method for Peptide class
Add the __len__ method to the Peptide class to enable len() function support
on peptide instances. This method returns the length of the peptide by
calculating the number of amino acids (AAs) it contains.




## BUG-FIX  
- fix-bug: mbapy\sci_instrument\mass\SCIEX.py: SciexMZMine: load_processed_data_file: add peak_df to avoid None error when saving processed_data  
- fix-bug: mbapy/scripts/peptide.py: fit-mass: check 'Monoisotopic' column existence in peak_df
Add a check to confirm the presence of the 'Monoisotopic' column in the peak_df dataframe. If the column is missing, a log message is generated and the script continues using all peaks instead of just monoisotopic ones. This prevents runtime errors when the expected column is not present.  
- fix-bug: mbapy/sci_instrument/mass/_utils.py: _plot_tag_by_match_df: correct mass calculation for iron-tagged peptides
The mass calculation for iron-tagged peptides has been updated to account for the iron mode specifics. Now the x-coordinate for plotting is adjusted based on the charge and iron mode parameters, ensuring accurate mass representation.
- fix-bug: mbapy\scripts\hplc.py: improve supported systems display in HPLC scripts
Update the help message for the '--system' argument in 'plot_hplc' and
'explore_hplc' classes to list supported systems as a comma-separated
string. This change clarifies the available options and improves the
readability of the argument's description.
- fix(bio): return empty string for empty seq in Peptide.__repr__
Peptide's representation now returns an empty string when the sequence is empty,
ensuring consistent behavior and avoiding representation errors.



  
## CODE-FIX 
- fix-code: C:\Users\BHMfly\Documents\My_Progs\BA\Python\BA_PY\mbapy\scripts\mass.py: plot-mass: feat(mass): add x and y axis labels to mass spectra plots
Plot now includes customizable x and y axis labels derived from the
data headers, enhancing the readability and usability of the generated
mass spectra plots.  
- feat(bio): add MutationOpts and MutationTree classes for peptide mutations
Implement new classes MutationOpts and MutationTree to facilitate peptide
mutation operations. This extends the functionality of the Peptide class by
allowing for more complex manipulations and optimizations in the mutation
process. The classes provide options for AA deletion, repetition, and
replacement, as well as management of N/C/R-protect group deletions.
- feat(scripts): optimize mutation weight calculation for peptides
Refactor the mutation_weight command to support new options such as
max_repeat, each_repeat, replace_aa, max_replace, and more. Simplify
the code by removing redundant functions and utilizing the new
MutationOpts and MutationTree classes. Prepare for multi-process
execution and handle output file writing more efficiently.
- feat(bio): optimize batch mutation weight calculation for peptides
Refactor the `calcu_mutations_mw_in_batch` function to support batch processing of peptide mutations. This change improves performance by reducing the overhead of repetitive calculations and sets the stage for parallel processing implementations. The function now accepts a list of peptides and returns a tuple of dictionaries mapping peptide representations to their indexes and molecular weights (or masses) to lists of peptides with those properties.
Additionally, introduced new utility functions and classes, such as `split_list`, `TaskPool`, `AnimoAcid`, and `MutationOpts`, to support the batch calculation and to enhance the modularity and maintainability of the codebase.
BREAKING CHANGE: The `calcu_peptide_mutations` function signature has been changed to accommodate the new `MutationOpts` parameter and to remove deprecated ones. This may affect existing clients of this function who have not yet updated their code to use the new signature.
