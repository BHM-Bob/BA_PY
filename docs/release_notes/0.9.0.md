## Focus on  
1. Fix bugs in scripts
2. Add more class and function in HPLC and Mass Spectrum
3. other fix

  
## What's New 
- addon(mbapy/scripts): add 'find-file' script
A new script named 'find-file' has been added to the mbapy-cli.
This script is designed to find files with specific suffixes or substrings in their
names, utilizing the argparse library for command-line argument parsing.  
- addon: mbapy\sci_instrument\hplc\waters.py: add WatersPdaData class  
- addon: mbapy\scripts\hplc.py: add extract_pda  



## Minor Addon
- feat(mbapy/file): add search_name_in_dir option to get_paths_with_extension
Introduce a new optional parameter `search_name_in_dir` in the
`get_paths_with_extension` function to allow users to specify whether
file names should be searched within directories. This enhancement
increases the flexibility and usability of the function for cases
where directory names contain the desired search string.  
- feat(mbapy/scripts): add include_dir_name option and refine file move logic
Introduce an additional argument '--include-dir-name' in the move_file script
to allow the inclusion of directory names in the search process. This
enhances the functionality of the script, providing more flexibility in file
searching and moving operations.
Refactor the file moving logic to gracefully handle permission issues on
Windows and Linux systems, ensuring smoother operation across different
platforms.  
- feat(mbapy): add get_dir function and update __all__
Implement a new function `get_dir` in the `mbapy/file.py` module. This function
allows for filtering directories based on various criteria such as minimum and
maximum item numbers, file extensions, and directory/sub-item name substrings.
The implementation enhances the module's capabilities in directory scanning and
filtering.
Additionally, update the `__all__` list to include the newly added function,
ensuring that it is documented and accessible to users of the module.  
- feat(scripts/_main_.py): add version and help print functions  
- refactor(utils): move seed setting into separate function for reuse
By extracting the random seed setting logic into its own function,
we improve code modularity and enable easier reuse of this functionality
across different parts of the application. This helps to ensure that
results are reproducible and that the codebase is easier to maintain.  
- minor-addon: mbapy/dl_torch/utils.py: init_model_parameter: add nn.Embedding support with xavier_normal_  
- minor-addon: mbapy\web_utils\task.py: TaskPool: add start and deprecate run method  
- minor-addon: mbapy\sci_instrument\hplc\_base.py: add IS_PDA attribute to HplcData class
Added an `IS_PDA` boolean attribute to the `HplcData` class to indicate if the
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data is from a Photodiode Array (PDA)
detector. This attribute defaults to `False` until specifically set to `True` for PDA
detector data analysis.  
- minor-addon: mbapy\sci_instrument\mass\_utils.py: add tag_monoisotopic_only option  


## BUG-FIX  
- fix(mbapy/scripts/avif): ensure progress bar updates for completed and in-doing batches
Add a sleep function during task execution in avif.py to allow the progress
bar to update properly for completed and ongoing tasks, preventing the
interface from appearing stuck due to a backlog of unprocessed tasks.  
- fix-bug: file: opts_file: when use yaml, now make sure Loader is in kwgs  
- fix-bug: mbapy/file.py: opts_file: kwgs now defaults to None to aoid default-kwargs-keep-alive bug  
- fix-bug: mbapy\scripts\mass.py: explore-mass: save fig name can be user define now  
- fix-bug: mbapy\scripts\mass.py: explore-mass: fig card now make right label  
- fix-bug: mbapy\web_utils\spider.py: DownloadPage: parse: get_valid_file_path before makedir to avoid parent folder name invalid error  
- fix-bug: mbapy\sci_utils\paper_search.py: search_by_pubmed: check `article_info['KeywordList']` is empty now  


## CODE-FIX 
- fix(sci_utils): remove redundant author_name assignment in parse_grobid
This change removes an unnecessary assignment of `author_name` that was causing
an issue with the parsing of author names in the `parse_grobid` function.  
- fix(mbapy/scripts/avif): improve progress bar update mechanism for task completion
Refactor the task execution loop in avif.py to ensure the progress bar accurately
reflects the completion status of tasks. This is achieved by updating the progress
bar only when tasks are actually done, in contrast to the previous approach which
could give the impression of stalling when the pool had more tasks than processors.  
- fix(mbapy/test/dl_t/optim): update import and iteration syntax for clarity
Refactor the import statement _str2scheduleF to str2scheduleF  
- fix-comment: mbapy\stats\test.py: pearsonr: fix comment  
- fix-code: change TaskPool.run to TaskPool.start  


## Remove  
None or a little.  
  
  
## Other Changes  
- fix(setup): update Python version support in setup.py
Extend support for Python 3.12 and adjust the python_requires constraint
to include version 3.12 while still excluding version 3.13 and above.  
- feat(requirements): add openpyxl to dependencies
Added openpyxl to the requirements.json file to ensure compatibility with
Excel file handling. This library is necessary for reading and writing
Excel workbooks using Python.
